This app follows [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gDhl4leEzA) closely. The differences are:
 - substituted "Like" Icon widgets for CircleAvatar widgets, which use a locally stored image
 - created a new function ```_generateMyPairs()```, which creates words based on a list defined in the file, instead of ```generateRandomPairs()``` from english_words library
 - uses custom colors (cyan) for the appBars
